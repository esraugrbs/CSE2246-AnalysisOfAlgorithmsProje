The Two Traveling Salesmen Problem (2-TSP) is a problem which two salesmen start from different arbitrary cities and must visit all given cities exactly once, finally returning to their respective starting points. The objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by both salesmen. This report outlines our approach to solving the 2-TSP, detailing the algorithm, implementation.
